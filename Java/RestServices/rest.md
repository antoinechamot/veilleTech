# Restful web services

## Soap vs Rest

- Soap : It is a remote procedure call. You have an endpoint and call a "method" passing an XML body to it.
- Rest : You construct the URL to a resource. You can use all HTTP verbs to work with those resources

=> HTTP standard make it very generic so every client can use it. Not always case with SOAP (Microsoft had own little flavor of SOAP)

Because of their simplicity and versality RESTful web services have become de facto standard for web services


## Rest 

Representation state transfert
- Representation : Mainly JSON or XML
- State transfert : Via HTTP

Verbs - HTTP methods : GET (read only), PUT (insert or update), POST (insert), DELETE

URI : uniform resource identifier
URL : uniform resource locator
